I had to google what coefficient means so please don't assume I'm some kind of genius scientist.

Have you ever tried to change a habit or turn your life around or tried to learn a new skill, maybe set a new years resolution half way through the year and then only a few weeks or months later you fall off the bandwagon and end up back at square one?

I feel like that's almost all of us right?

Well, there's something I figured out recently that maybe you have too.

The quicker and more intensely I try to change my life the less sustainable that change is.


## The fastest way to change your life is one day at a time.


The quicker you try to create changes in your life the more energy it will take and that by definition is less sustainable. The key is to find the balance between sustainability and rate of change.

Would you rather change quickly, or permanently?

So how do you find the balance? The quickest way to change your life is one day at a time. Unless you have a space ship capable of going at near light speed we only have the ability to live life one day at a time. So, there's no point in trying to change any quicker than that.

Even if you're following Elon Musk's advice and trying to achieve your 10 year goals in 6 months, you still have to live those six months, one - day - at - a - time.

It's taken over 15 years for me to realise this and it's only just been sinking in the last few months as I've managed to start taking control of my money and escape my overdraft.

Now I'm experimenting with my diet to try and get my diabetes under control. I've tried before to get my diet under control. Once I went 100 days with no junk food, least helthy food I had was jam on toast.

Probably something David Goggins fan boys would slap me accross the face for but considering I used to order a fillet burger meal and an extra fillet burger and then on the way home with my food get 2 six inch subs from subway and then go home and have to take a break from eating my lunch I think I did pretty well.

I managed to complete the 100 days but it was miserable. Definitely not sustainable for the long term because I'm not trying to win Mr Olympia. I just don't want man boobs and a flat ass.
