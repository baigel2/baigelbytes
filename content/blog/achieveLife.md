<br>


We're going to have to go old school. Older than old school. I'm telling you, when I say back, I mean waaaaaaay back!


<br>


**Issac Newton.**

<br>

Yeah.

<br>


Now you get it. Centuries back!

<br>


If not all of us, most of us but no less than that many, have tried before; to improve, to progress, to lose weight, to make more money, to start something new. And anyone who's tried and tried has no doubt failed and failed along the way.

Pre-covid it was all about the David Goggins approach, the GO GO GO!!!! Until we were forced, all of us, to slow the fuck down! Grinding through life tired us out and then we discovered we didn't even need to be grinding that hard to make the world go round after all. It does that all on it's own, who'd have thought?

For the longest time I wanted to make it in life. I wanted to be able to travel the world, I thought I wanted to be rich, really rich, like owning a subarine rich. Then I discovered what really mattered. The most valuable resource in the entire universe.

Time.

You won't get an extra second of it added to your life and yet we throw it away for what is literally the most abundand resource on the planet. Money. There's a better way. Life's been teaching me some lessons I think could benefit you too so let's dive in.


## You don't need to be a billionare, or even a millionare (maybe).

There's a relationship between how much wealth you want to acquire and how much work it takes to get there. If you want to be a billionare, you will be working 25/8/366. There will be no you time unless you're willing to fall behind on something or more than often, a whole bunch of things.

Until you get to the point where you can hire CEO's you're going to have you're work cut out for you. The more you want, the more you have to work and the less time you'll have. If that's worth it for you then great but this is where I was mistaken.

It wasn't wealth I craved. It was freedom. You know what freedom is? Time. Time that you can spend however the fuck you want. That's real wealth!

Let me ask you a question.

If there was no such thing as money and all your material needs, food, roof etc were taken care of, what would you do with your life. There'd be no use making a business if getting rich was your goal, no such thing as money remember. You know what I'd do? Three things:

<br>

1. I would write.
2. I would travel the world.
3. I would spend time with friends and family.

<br>

So guess what. I'm going to do just that. Except, we do live in a world where money exists and so I'm forced to pay attention to it, at least to the extent that I need to in order to be able to live that life i just outlined. But like I said, if you're trying to get to millions or billions in income you're not going to have any time left to live the life you're working so hard for. There needs to be a balance.

My balance, the thing that will fund my life will be trading. I'm starting with stock trading and might just stick with that to be honest. Swing trading till I get to a full time income and then when I quit working for people I'll start dipping my toes in a little day trading.

## Why trading?

The beauty of trading is that it's not tied to how many hours you work. You don't have to do it for anyone and you can work anywhere that you have an internet connection. You can start with as little as £100 but the more you start with the quicker you can get to a full time income **IF** and only if you manage two things consistently, appropriately and accurately.

* Your emotions.
* Your risk.

2% per trade, that's it. If I have a grand to start with that's £20 per trade and it means I'd have to get 50 trades in a row wrong to run out of money. That's one part. The other is managing my emotions and this is the crucial part, this is why I've given myself an entire calendar year just to learn the basics. One whole year just to get to the starting line.

Because I knew there'd be many things I havent even thought to question, things I had no idea I'd need to know. I have a bunch of bad habits like gluttony and impulse buying, things lots of people suffer with but if I want to stand any chance at all of making it as a trader, those are things I can not afford.

Learning how to read the charts is the obvious thing but it's meaningless if I can't control my emotions and if I cant stop myself from risking too much of my money on a trade.

Gaining these abilities and splicing them into my identity as a part of who I am is going to take time, but in the grand scheme of things, this is the shortest and straightest path to sustainable, consistent life long, success.

Trading is the only thing that I can see that will give me both the money to be able to fund my life **AND** the time to actually live it!

Why trading? That's why!

## So, Newton?

Where does Newton come into all of this? In a world where the majority of influencers will try and get you hyped up like a wall street trader who's just done a mile long line of cocaine there is a growing number of people who are tired of the grind. A growing number of people who would just rather sail.

How would you do this? Simple.

Slowly.

I mean really slowly. Make changes so small that they seem almost unnoticable on the day to day. Once you get used to a change, only then should you add something to it. Before you know it, you'll look back on the years and see just how much compounding took place.

People like newton were not concerned with what they achieved in a single year or month, and in a day? How much do you care about what happened in the last 15 seconds? People like Newton and perhaps like you, cared and will care about what they achieved over the course of their entire lives.

**Decades.** That's the timeline. Diet, exercise, finances, relationships, family, friends. I'm thinking about how I'm going to improve continuosly, for decades not just months or weeks and then burn out. I wan't to still be looking after my health and my family in 30 years time. I don't want to grind like a maniac for 3 months and then crash and burn only to have to start all over again.

<br>

Listen to me.

<br>

> "Sometimes, the slower you go, the faster you'll get there."

<br>

Just like the tortoise and the hare.


Have fun learning. I'll see you in ten years.
