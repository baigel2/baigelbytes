For some reason Hugo renders indented text as code blocks. It didn't use to do this.

I am an aspiring writer and not a coder so I don't want or need to have code blocks popping up on my blog. Indentation is neccasary in fiction so readers know when the speakers change.

I have an older post that has indentation but it does not get rendered as code blocks.

Here is an indented line copied from that file. I believe I used 2 tabs to indent:


                  "Ok bubbly, first we say..."


Here I will copy the same line from that file but replace the space at the beginning with two tabs:

		"Ok bubbly, first we say..."


And again with spaces instead of tabs:


                  "Ok bubbly, first we say..."


And now with 2 tabs and then two spaces after the tabs:

		  "Ok bubbly, first we say..."

A suggestion from copilot is listed below using Klingon to make spaces at the beginning of the line:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indented text.

That made it look like there were only a few spaces lets see what happens if we only copy one:

&nbsp;This is indented text.
